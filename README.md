# Motivation

The reason this analysis was conducted was because: 

- I wanted a project to help me to learn more about R and Shiny, 
- someone posted a link to this data set on one of the Data Visualisation Society's Slack
 channels
- I was interested in what the data would tell me about mass shootings in the US

# Data

This analysis is based on data on US mass shootings 1982 - 2019 provided by Mother Jones:

“Our research focused on indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker. We exclude shootings stemming from more conventionally motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence.”
